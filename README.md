# 🧪 Breast Cancer Detection using Machine Learning

This project focuses on building a machine learning model to detect breast cancer using the **UCI Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset**. The goal is to classify whether a tumor is **benign** or **malignant** based on various features computed from digitized images of a breast mass.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (for visualization)

## 🧠 ML Techniques Used

- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Feature Scaling (StandardScaler)
- Model Building:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest Classifier
- Hyperparameter Tuning with `GridSearchCV`
- Model Evaluation (Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Classification Report)
